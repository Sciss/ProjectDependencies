Small graphviz project for me to keep track of my libraries at [GitHub](https://github.com/Sciss). 

 - Unless noted, Scala project use version 2.9.2
 - Artifact IDs for Scala libraries are constructed with prefix `"de.sciss" %%"`
 - Artifact IDs for Java libraries are constructed with prefix `"de.sciss" %"`
 - Scala projects have black outline, Sbt plugins have blue outline, Java projects have green outline
 - red outline indicates projects still rely on older versions of dependencies
 - Arrows point from dependent to dependency
 - Versions refer to latest stable. If a newer snapshow exists, outline is dotted
 - Test-only dependencies have dotted arrows.
